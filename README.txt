The other file in this repository, Checkers_game.py, is a Python source file containing a programming project I'd like to share with you. To run this program, download the file and double click on it. 

If double clicking doesn't work, you can run it through online Python environments such as replit.com. You can also simply run it from the command line directly if you have Python installed on your computer. Just navigate through the command line to the folder the file is stored in, and run the command: python3 Checkers_game.py. 


This program is a project I worked on for three weeks during a summer program.


It is the game of checkers, complete with a decently skilled AI opponent. 
You play blue, and the AI plays green. 

In this version of checkers, capture moves are forced moves - if you can capture an opposing piece, the program will not allow you to make any other move besides capturing.
The AI is not too difficult to beat - I've beaten it several times - but it can put up a serious fight. 

The project has a ton of room for improvment, and there are still some bugs lurking in the code, but given the time frame I had and my limited programming experience going into this project (1 year), I'm fairly happy with how it turned out.

Enjoy!
